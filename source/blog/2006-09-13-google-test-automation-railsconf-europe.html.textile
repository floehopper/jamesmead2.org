Last week I was at Google's inaugural "London Test Automation Conference":http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/4135 where I particularly enjoyed the talk by Adam Connors and "Joe Walnes":http://joe.truemesh.com/blog/ entitled "Does my button look big in this? Building Testable AJAX Applications".  It should be out on "Google Video":http://video.google.com/ any day now (as are all the "talks":http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/events/londontesters/speakers.html) and is well worth a look.

It was also good to hear from "Nat Pryce":http://nat.truemesh.com/ and "Steve Freeman":http://stevef.truemesh.com/ about the "new developments":http://cvs.jmock.codehaus.org/browse/jmock/jmock2 in "JMock":http://www.jmock.org/

Tomorrow I'm off to "RailsConf Europe":http://europe.railsconf.org/. Should be fun.

Updates:
* the LTAC talk videos are "here":http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=london+test+automation+conference (thanks Ade).
