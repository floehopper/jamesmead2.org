h2. Release Notes

h3. 0.10.5
* Fix for "issue #66":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/66 (hopefully without regressing on "issue #63":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/63) - @Mocha::Mock@ has @Mocha::Mockery@ as a dependency. Stop trying to pretend otherwise. Thanks to "@kennyj":https://github.com/kennyj for reporting.
* Fix a bunch of warnings in Ruby 1.9. There are still the 6 test failures mentioned in "issue #41":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/41 which I suspect are due to the introspection gem not being Ruby 1.9-compatible.
* Add links to README for source code & issue tracker.
* Fix for "issue #67":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/67 - Make the travis-ci badge visible in the README. Thanks to Diego Plentz for pull request.
* Fix for "issue #70":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/70 - Rename @Mock#expectations@ to @Mock#__expectations__@ to avoid conflicts. Thanks to Jeremy Stephens for pull request.

h3. 0.10.4
* Fix for "issue #65":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/65 - expectations not being verified in subsequent tests.
* Fix for "issue #63":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/63 - require @Mocha::Mockery@ at @Mocha::Mock@ class load time and not on invocation of Mock#method_missing.
* Fix for "issue #45":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/45 - raise @ArgumentError@ if @Mocha::ParameterMatchers#has_entry@ is given
@Hash@ with wrong number of entries.
* Make global variable name more obscure to avoid clashes with other libraries.
* Move travis-ci-related gemfiles into their own directory.

h3. 0.10.3
* Fix for "issue #57":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/57. @Gem::Requirement#=~@ was only added in rubygems v1.8.0, but @Object#=~@ means the result of various monkey-patching checks is always @false@ or @nil@ for earlier versions of rubygems. However, the method it aliases @#satisfied_by?@ has existed since @Gem::Dependency@ was extracted from @Gem::Version@ in rubygems v0.9.4.4, so it's much safer to use that. Thanks to "@fguillen":https://github.com/fguillen for reporting and helping with diagnosis.

h3. 0.10.2
* Merge pull request #53. Unstubbing a method should not remove expectations for other stubbed methods. Fixes #52. Thanks to "@saikat":https://github.com/saikat.

h3. 0.10.1
* Merge "pull request #51":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/pull/51. Use @Gem::Requirement@ & @Gem::Version@ for version comparison. Fixes "issue #50":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/50. Thanks to "@meineerde":https://github.com/meineerde.
* Fixed typo in rdoc for @Mocha::ObjectMethods@.
* Improve README as suggested in "issue #46":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/46. Explain that Mocha must be loaded after test libraries and how to achieve this using Bundler.
* Merge "pull request #43":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/pull/43 - nobody expects the spanish inquisition! Thanks to "@cairo140":https://github.com/cairo140.
* Fix for "issue #39":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/39 - improve documentation for @Expectation#multiple_yields@.
* Fix for "issue #38":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/38 where a subtle change in test-unit v2.3.0 had been missed - only visible in verbose mode.
* Support for MiniTest up to v2.6.2 has been verified.
* Add explicit development dependency on @coderay@ for generating syntax-highlighted code examples.

h3. 0.10.0
* Add Expectation#throws to allow a stubbed method to use Kernel#throw.
* Updates for versions of Test::Unit up to and including v2.3.3 (including patch by Jens Fahnenbruck).
* Updates for versions of MiniTest up to and including v2.5.1.
* Since the singleton method added by Mocha masks the underlying instance method, there's no need to move it out the way and then back again. This fixes Github "issue #20":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/20, because the original method is left unchanged - See "issue #20":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/20 (thanks to "@nicklewis":https://github.com/nicklewis).
* Handle stubbing of a singleton method, leaving the original method unchanged after the test.
* When stubbing an instance method that was originally defined as a singleton method, the original method should still exist after the test.
* Fixed mis-print in Mocha::ObjectMethods#unstub documentation (patch by "@glebpom":https://github.com/glebpom).
* Improved test coverage around stubbing of methods defined in different ways - this makes use of the newly extracted introspection gem (although this means some tests are now failing in Ruby v1.9.2).
* Added configuration for Travis continuous integration.
* Make the gemspec the canonical reference and stop generating it from the Rakefile.
* Use the built-in Bundler rake tasks for packaging the gem.
* Use the @release@ rake task provided by Bundler instead of using the Rake::XForge::Release functionality.
* Extract @Object#__metaclass__@ into a new @metaclass@ gem.
* Run rake tasks without @bundle exec@.
* Avoid deprecation warning for @rdoc@ rake task.
* Remove the @use_test_unit_gem@ @MOCHA_OPTION@ which hasn't worked since we switched to bundler - we can now run the tests specifying a different @Gemfile@ instead.
* Use multiple Gemfiles seems to run Travis CI builds against multiple version of test-unit & minitest.
