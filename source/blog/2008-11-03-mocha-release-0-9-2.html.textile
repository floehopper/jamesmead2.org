h2. Release Notes

* Improved documentation to address "[#22530]":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=22530&group_id=1917&atid=7480 Mock methods with multiple return values not possible?
* respond_with parameter matcher was not available in tests.
* Patch "[#22630]":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=22630&group_id=1917&atid=7479 Fix for a bug in running Rails tests with Ruby 1.8.7. Array#flatten was being called which in turn was checking whether each element responded to #to_ary. This check was using the two parameter version of #respond_to?, but Mock was only defining a one parameter version.
