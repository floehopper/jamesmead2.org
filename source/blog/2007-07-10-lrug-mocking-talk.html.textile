I did a presentation at the "LRUG":http://www.lrug.org meeting last night. The title of the talk was "An Introduction to Mocking in Ruby":http://www.lrug.org/meetings/2007/06/20/july-2007-meeting/. I'm not big on public speaking so I found the whole thing a bit daunting, so thanks to everyone for being so friendly.

In retrospect I think I spent too much time on preparing the slides and not enough time practicing it. The fact that hadn't read the whole thing through in one go meant I had no idea how long it would be. Inevitably I ended up over-running which curtailed "Tom Stuart's":http://obsess.com/ excellent presentation on RSpec. I felt particularly bad because he was obviously a much better presenter than me.

I hope to make my slides available at some point - this should fairly easy, because I used "Paul's":http://po-ru excellent mashup of the "S5 slide show system":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ with "Textile":http://hobix.com/textile/ and "Syntax":http://syntax.rubyforge.org/.
