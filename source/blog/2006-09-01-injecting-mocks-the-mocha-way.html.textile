I thought I'd compare and contrast the way "Gluttonous":http://glu.ttono.us/ was "injecting mocks":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/30/injecting-mocks-one-way-or-another and how you can do it with "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/.

h2. Gluttonous' way

bc(prettyprint). def test_process_exit
  delegate_methods_to_mock!(RailsFCGIHandler, :close_connection) do
    fcgi = flexmock()
    fcgi.should_receive(:close_connection)
    @handler.mock = fcgi
    @handler.stubs(:when_ready).returns(:exit)
    @handler.process!
  end
end

h2. Using Mocha

bc(prettyprint). def test_process_exit
  @handler.expects(:close_connection)
  @handler.stubs(:when_ready).returns(:exit)
  @handler.process!
end

p. I think it's a bit more readable and you don't need the block construction which starts becoming a nuisance when you need to stub methods on multiple classes.
