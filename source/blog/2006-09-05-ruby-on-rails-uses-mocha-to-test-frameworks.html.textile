So thanks to "Kev Clark's":http://glu.ttono.us/ interest and hard work, it looks like "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ is being used to improve test coverage in some of the "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com/ frameworks - take a look at this "patch":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4913.
