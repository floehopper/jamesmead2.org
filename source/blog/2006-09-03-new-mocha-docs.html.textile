Spurred on by "Thorsten's comment":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/09/02/mocking-models#comment-1106 on "Gluttonous' blog":http://glu.ttono.us/ and a mention of "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ in the "Top 5 Rails Stories of the Week":http://cleanair.highgroove.com/articles/2006/09/03/ruby_on_rails_enterprise_capistrano_mocked_models_class_variables_rest, I've given the Mocha "documentation":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ a major overhaul.

Now the "RDoc":http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/ only shows the public API which should hopefully improve the signal-to-noise ratio and show how simple it is to use.

* "Create traditional mock objects":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/AutoVerify.html
* "Set expectations on traditional mock objects":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/MockMethods.html
* "Set expectations on real (non-mock) classes":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Object.html
* "Make expectations more specific or define behaviour of stub":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/Mocha/Expectation.html

I've also had a play with "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/ and generated syntax-highlighted examples.
* "Quick Start":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/file.misc.html
* "Traditional mocking":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/file.mocha.html
* "Setting expectations on real (non-mock) classes":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/file.stubba.html

Good general information on mocking...
