It's good to see that a team from "my old company":http://www.thoughtworks.com has caught the "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ bug...

"Jay Fields":http://jayfields.blogspot.com/ describes how his team have been using Mocha to achieve "Ruby on Rails Unit Testing in less than 1 second":http://jayfields.blogspot.com/2006/09/rubyrails-unit-testing-in-less-than-1.html.
