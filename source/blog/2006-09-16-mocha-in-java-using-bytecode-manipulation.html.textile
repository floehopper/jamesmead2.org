My former colleague and "bytecode":http://asm.objectweb.org/ maestro "Stacy Curl":http://digital-compulsion.blogspot.com/ has an "interesting article":http://digital-compulsion.blogspot.com/2006/09/java-mocking-without-injection-same.html explaining how it would be possible to implement "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ in "Java":http://java.sun.com/ using experience from his "PicoUnit":http://picounit.codehaus.org/ project.

It's good to be reminded that meta-programming is possible in Java, but just a bit more effort.
