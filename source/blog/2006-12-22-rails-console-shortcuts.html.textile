A couple of quick nuggets I picked up from Amy Hoy's "Secrets of the Rails Console Ninjas":http://slash7.com/articles/2006/12/21/secrets-of-the-rails-console-ninjas.

Firstly, the magic @y@ method which dumps an object to YAML - much more readable than the standard @inspect@ output.

bc. >> y james
--- !ruby/object:User
attributes:
  firstname: James
  surname: Mead
  login: floehopper
new_record: true
 => nil

Secondly, clear your console using @command + k@ (or @ctrl + l@ for those on Windows)

Thanks, Amy.
