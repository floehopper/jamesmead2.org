I just realised I forgot to celebrate my second Reevoo "birthday":/blog/2006-09-06-my-reevoo-birthday.

So to make up for that I just worked out (not very scientifically) that in the 2 years 2 months I've been working at "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com, I've travelled almost twice round the world by "GNER":http://www.gner.co.uk train. And that doesn't include my travel on London commuter trains, tubes & buses...

Distance from Durham to London Kings Cross = 232 miles as the crow flies[1].

Journeys per week = 2

Number of weeks (excluding holidays) = 48 + 48 + 8 = 104

Total distance travelled = 104 * 2 * 232 = 48,256 miles

"Earth's":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth circumference = 24,901 miles according to "About.com":http://geography.about.com/library/faq/blqzcircumference.htm

Twice round the world = 2 * 24,901 = 49,802 miles

Anyway, I'm tired and that was tricky maths, so I've probably made a mistake. Probably time to go to bed.

fn1. according to "Google Maps":http://maps.google.co.uk Distance Measurement Tool
