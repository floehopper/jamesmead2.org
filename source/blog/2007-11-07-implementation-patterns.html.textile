I'm looking forward to reading Kent Beck's new book "Implementation Patterns":http://www.amazon.co.uk/Implementation-Patterns-Kent-Beck/dp/0321413091  which has been "reviewed on InfoQ":http://www.infoq.com/articles/implementations-patterns-br. I've had it on pre-order at Amazon and it's just been dispatched. I always meant to read his Smalltalk equivalent "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns":http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X, but never quite got round to it.
