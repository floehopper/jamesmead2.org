h2. Release Notes

* Allow "@Mocha::ParameterMatchers#includes@":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/Mocha/ParameterMatchers.html#includes-instance_method to accept multiple items. Thanks to "Sim√£o Mata":https://github.com/simao.
* Allow stubbing of *private* @Kernel@ methods. Fixes "issue #134":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/134. Thanks to "@camski":https://github.com/camski for reporting.
* Avoid a warning when @test/unit/version@ is required by other libraries in the same project. Fixes "issue #140":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/140. Thanks to "Tom Miller":https://github.com/tmiller.
* Make auto-activation of Test::Unit integration more resilient. This change is specifically to cope with the nasty re-defining of classes that is done by the @minitest-spec-rails@ gem. Fixes "issue #143":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/143. Thanks to "@tubaxenor":https://github.com/tubaxenor for reporting.
* Safer restoration of stubbed method visibility. Fixes "issue #141":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/141. Thanks to "Aman Gupta":https://github.com/tmm1.
* Ensure @Mockery@ instance gets reset even if exception raised. Fixes "issue #144":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/144.
* Adapt Mocha acceptance tests to cope with changes in output from latest (v4.6.2) of MiniTest.
* Updates to README about Rails compatibility.
