h2. Release Notes

* Although I had provided a deprecation warning for people using the now renamed "Mocha::Standalone":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/API.html, I had assumed people wouldn't be explicitly loading the @mocha/standalone.rb@ file. It turns out this assumption was incorrect at least in the case of "RSpec":http://rspec.info/. This is now fixed.
