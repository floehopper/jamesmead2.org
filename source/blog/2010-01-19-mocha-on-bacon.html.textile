Some time ago, I "removed Bacon integration from Mocha":http://github.com/floehopper/mocha/commit/da24f9e93640381973b1604b8a1ff3214b0831c9 after "deciding":http://groups.google.com/group/mocha-developer/msg/fd008b21e34638df to only maintain integration with
"Test::Unit":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html and "MiniTest":http://blog.zenspider.com/minitest/ which are both Ruby standard libraries.

Happily "Eloy Duran":http://superalloy.nl/ has just "re-incarnated the Mocha adapter for Bacon":http://github.com/alloy/mocha-on-bacon. He's updated the code a bit and re-written the tests. Thanks, Eloy.

Here's an example of what you can do with "Bacon":http://gemcutter.org/gems/bacon and "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ :-

bc(prettyprint).. require File.expand_path('../spec_helper', __FILE__)

describe "Bacon specs using Mocha, with a mock" do

  extend MochaBaconHelper

  it "passes when all expectations were fulfilled" do
    mockee = mock()
    lambda do
      mockee.expects(:blah)
      mockee.blah
    end.should.be satisfied
  end

end
