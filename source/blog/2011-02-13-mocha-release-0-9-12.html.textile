h2. Release Notes

* Make Mocha's tests pass under Ruby 1.9.2 i.e. using MiniTest. One of the main issues was that we were not parsing stack traces on MiniTest errors comprehensively enough.
* Avoid 'circular require considered harmful' warning when running Mocha's tests in Ruby 1.9.2
* Make performance tests work on Ruby 1.9.2 i.e. using MiniTest.
* Declare rake as a *development* dependency with newer versions of Rubygems since it's only needed to carry out developer-related tasks.
