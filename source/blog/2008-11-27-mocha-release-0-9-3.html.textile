h2. Release Notes

* Added support for "MiniTest":http://blog.zenspider.com/2008/10/minitest-version-130-has-been.html thanks to "sprsquish":http://github.com/sprsquish/mocha/commit/5b0e73f70aefb1dab4aa955f87dac1e5b8d1a2b8.
* Fixed a possible bug with some of the non-default Configuration options relating to the argument to "Object#respond_to?":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M000333
* As per "Jay Fields":http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/07/ruby-underuse-of-modules.html "recommendations":http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/07/ruby-redefine-method-behavior.html and with further impetus from a talk on "Unobtrusive Metaprogramming":http://effectif.com/2008/11/23/notes-from-the-ruby-manor-part-2 by Sean O'Halpin at "Ruby Manor":http://rubymanor.org/, any methods added to core classes are now added by including a module. This means that Mocha is a better citizen of the Ruby world and it's behaviour is more easily extended.
* Removed deprecated gem autorequire.
