"Matt Edgar":http://me63.wordpress.com/ has written "an interesting article":http://me63.wordpress.com/2006/11/01/gee-any-arghh/ about a situation on a "GNER":http://www.gner.co.uk/ train that I find all-too-familiar. In fact I'm sure it won't be long before it happens to me. One of the issues is "the ridiculous number of ticket types available":/blog/2006-08-03-a-plethora-of-train-tickets.
