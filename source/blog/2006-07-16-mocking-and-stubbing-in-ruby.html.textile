Over the last few months, I've been working on "Mocha":http://rubyforge.org/projects/mocha which is a Ruby mocking library with a syntax like that of "JMock":http://www.jmock.org and "SchMock":http://rubyforge.org/projects/schmock. And I've finally got round to putting it up on "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org.

Mocha comes in three parts:

* *Mocha* - traditional mock objects with expectations and verification
* *Stubba* - allows mocking and stubbing of methods on real (non-mock) classes
* *AutoMocha* - magically provides mocks in the place of undefined classes

Mocha and Stubba have been created by amalgamating a number of techniques developed by me and my "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com colleagues ("Ben":http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths, "Chris":http://blog.seagul.co.uk and "Paul":http://po-ru.com) into a common syntax. Both Mocha and Stubba are in use on real-world "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org projects.

AutoMocha is more experimental and is at an earlier stage of development. It's an attempt to make it easier to write _true_ unit tests (i.e. tests with no external dependencies).

You can find examples in the "RDoc":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ README and in the acceptance tests.
