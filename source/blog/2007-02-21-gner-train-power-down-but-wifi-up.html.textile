I'm writing this sitting just south of Darlington on a "GNER":http://www.gner.co.uk train heading for Durham. The power has just gone down and we have emergency lighting, but bizarrely I still have wireless access!

Apparently a freight train transporting hazardous chemicals has broken down in front of us and they've had to call the fire brigade and switch off the overhead power lines. Earlier two GNER trains out of London Kings Cross were cancelled - including the one I was booked on - but fortunately I managed to get a seat on this one - many didn't as there were 3 trains worth of people on 1 train.

All very jolly and ironic as I was reading an article on the the Guardian's website about how GNER have "not made the shortlist for the east coast rail franchise":http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2017593,00.html.
