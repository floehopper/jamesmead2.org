A while ago "Jay Fields":http://jayfields.blogspot.com/ described a number of ways to "share Ruby code":http://jayfields.blogspot.com/2006/10/rubygems-shared-ruby-code.html between projects and focussed on a useful technique which involves using "RubyGems":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/ and unpacking them into your vendor directory. He also mentions the difficulties of versioning with "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/ plugins.

We use a number of "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/ plugins at "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com. Initially we used "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ externals to include them in our projects, but for a while now we've been successfully using "Fran√ßois Beausoleil's":http://blog.teksol.info/ "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ which is effectively an extension to "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/. You end up with a copy of the plugin code in your own repository with the relevant revision number from the remote repository stored in your own "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ metadata. "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ prevents you getting new versions of the plugin code every time you update (as you would with an svn:external) which can lead to unexpected changes, but makes it straightforward to update to a newer version of a plugin when you want.

You can find Piston "here":http://piston.rubyforge.org/.
