You're almost certainly here because you clicked a link on a search engine results page. That link was taking you to one of my 'tag' pages: a page that contained all the posts with that tag e.g.  @http://blog.floehopper.org/articles/tag/mocha@. Like "Chris Roos":http://chrisroos.co.uk/tags, I didn't like these pages, because they're basically search results within search results. So, I've got rid of them.

In the process of removing these tag pages, I've tagged all my posts in "Delicious":http://delicious.com/ so that you can replicate the old 'tag' pages. To do so, you'll need to search my bookmarks for the @jamesmead.org@ tag and whichever tag it was that you were trying to visit e.g. to see all my posts tagged @mocha@, you can visit "http://delicious.com/jamesmead/jamesmead.org+mocha":http://delicious.com/jamesmead/jamesmead.org+mocha (replace @mocha@ with the tag you were trying to find).
